# OLED-0010 SPI library

This is an Arduino library used for driving 16x2 OLED displays that utilise the OLED-0010 driver via SPI mode

## Features

* Used to drive monochrome 16x2 OLED displays
* Supports all basic features of the standard LiquidCrystal library
* Seems to work!

## Modifying OLED to support SPI

I've gone into detail on how to switch the OLED display I had over to using the SPI interface [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3vZD-mdRNZ8), however your display may be different.
